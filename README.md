### Customer Query Classification

*  We will build a customer query classifier that will take customer queries and classify them or label them with a department name. This classifier can or will be incorporated into a system that can route the query to the appropriate department for further processing.

*  The dataset was generated via API (OpenAI). The code can be find here :

*  The generated CSV file can be find here :
