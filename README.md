### Customer Query Classification

*  We will build a customer query classifier that will take customer queries and classify them or label them with a department name. This classifier can or will be incorporated into a system that can route the query to the appropriate department for further processing.

*  The dataset was generated via API (OpenAI). The notebook can be find here :
  https://github.com/hjavadnia/509_Group_Project_20/blob/main/Generate_%20Data_OpenAI.ipynb

*  The generated CSV file can be find here :
  https://github.com/hjavadnia/509_Group_Project_20/blob/main/customer_query.csv

*  This supervised classification has 4 labels (Returns, Tech. Support, Product inquiries, Billing and payments)

* Size of dataset: 40,000
